title: 'REST Assertions'
---

Each assrtion should start with defining the service you want to check. You do this by:

```js
expectTrace(traceloop.serviceByName('service-name'))...
```

These are the options you can use for service selection:

- `serviceByName` - the name of the service as reported in the `service.name` attribute
  (automatically reported by [Traceloop's init container](/jest-otel/no-otel))
- `serviceByK8sPodName` - the name of the pod as reported by Kubernetes
- `serviceByCustomAttribute` - any custom attribute reported by your service to OpenTelemetry

Following that, you can use any of the following assertions:

- `toSendHttpRequest`
- `toReceiveHttpRequest`

Then, you can specifically assert for each of the properties of the request:

- `withBody`
- `withHeader`
- `ofMethod`
- `withStatusCode`

So, a complete assertion can look like:

```js
expectTrace(traceloop.serviceByName('users-service'))
  .toReceiveHttpRequest()
  .ofMethod('POST')
  .withHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')
  .withBody({
    id: 1,
    name: 'John Doe',
    address: '123 Main St',
  });
```
